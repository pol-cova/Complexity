# **Complexity**

## **Introduction**
Welcome to the **Complexity**! This web-based tool takes mathematical functions as input and creates stunning **3D animations** of them using **Three.js** and **Next.js**. Whether you're a student, educator, or enthusiast, this tool helps you visualize complex mathematical functions in an intuitive and interactive way.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Next.js** – A fast React framework for building web applications.
- **Three.js** – A 3D JavaScript library that makes creating 3D graphics on the web simple.
- **React** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development.
- **JavaScript/ES6** – For all the dynamic functionality and interactivity.
